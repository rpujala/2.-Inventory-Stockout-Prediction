# 2.-Inventory-Stockout-Prediction
Predict whether a given SKU is likely to stock out in the next 7 days

# Problem Statement

* The supply chain operations team at a global manufacturing company frequently faces unexpected SKU stockouts at regional warehouses. These stockouts cause delayed shipments, expedited freight costs, and customer dissatisfaction.

* To proactively mitigate this, the team wants a machine learning system that can **predict whether a given SKU is likely to stock out in the next 7 days**, allowing planners to trigger replenishment or reallocation actions in advance.

* The solution must work at SKU x warehourse x time level, handle missing operational data, and be explainable enough for planners to trust the predictions
